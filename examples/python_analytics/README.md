# Python Analytics server

This server exists to track usage patterns of Python applications,
primarily within an enterprise development environment. Within a large
organization there are all different manners of setups, software
versions, and other complexity, so it helps to track these factors to
know what users require what sort of support. At PayPal, we have used
it to stay ahead of the curve of changing architectures and updating compilers, as well as getting real data on the phase out of old versions of Python.
