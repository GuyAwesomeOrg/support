Asynchronous Helpers
====================

SuPPort is fundamentally based on asynchronous event processing using
gevent_. However, gevent is relatively light on guidance and utilities
for developing a holistically robust and responsive server. The
``support.async`` module provides helpers that fill these gaps. Refer
to the :ref:`Infallibility section of the Architecture document
<infallibility>` for some of the high-level concepts.
